# Version 1: Initial Commit

# Version 2: I learned a few cool things by watching Colt's method.
   Use <span id=""></span> to encase each players score so they can be individually
   selected and updated and change the color.

   For the input number box, use change instead of click or mouseup. That way it
   updates if I type in the box too as opposed to having to click the up arrows.

   I also added some <-- ==========
                           labels 
                         ========== --> in order to more easily find each section of code.
